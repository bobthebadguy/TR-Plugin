###Troll commands -That one thing no one really wanted
This is a little plugin that I thought of and now it kinda works.
##
###Current commands
All commands start with `/tr`.
Ex: `/tr smite 5226`

You can use `/tr info` for a list of commands as well.

| Command | Parameter | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
|`smite`|&lt;uid&gt;|Smites player, killing them.|
|`lightning`|&lt;intensity&gt;|Summons a lightning storm, WIP|
|`kill`|&lt;uid&gt;|Kills player, but freezes server?|
|`trapcore`|[on/off]|Keeps players from respawning.|
